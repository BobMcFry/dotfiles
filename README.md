# My dotfile Repository
As with other dotfile repos this one is sort of the perfect combination of the strengths of many dotfile repos I've seen. Take a look and copy whatever you like.

## Installation
Usually this is done by the install.sh but as it is not yet functional the following steps need to be done:
1. Clone this repository to `${HOME}/.dotfiles`. If this is not to your liking symlink via `${HOME}/.dotfiles` to the repository.
1. Create symlinks to the files `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, `tmux.conf`, `.bash_profile`, and `.gitignore_global`
